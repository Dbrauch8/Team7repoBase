Surveys will employ diving, technical diving, ROV, and hydroacoustics technologies for a comprehensive assessment of the fish and benthic habitat communities of the East and West Bank.
The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities.
During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will be to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and communities.</abstract><purpose>1) To design an appropriate sampling and monitoring strategies for fish and benthic community sampling, as well as data collection, during the first year funding,  2) during  subsequent years, focus on refinement of the sampling strategies and continuing to build on the baseline dataset, 3) groundtruthing and collection of underwater imagery and video to improve existing map products, 4) the banks begin at 150m depth and reach to within 17m of the water's surface, therefore multiple survey techniques will need to be employed using a random stratified sampling design. An ROV will be utilized to survey the deeper water communities, a combination of divers and technical divers will survey the banks down to ~50m, and ship-based hydroacoustics will be utilized to survey fish densities over the entire depth range; and 5) to analyze the information gathered to help guide sanctuary resource management decisions.</purpose><supplinf>This work is being conducted in collaboration with the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), NOAA's Center for Coastal Environment and Health and Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR), NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Ocean Exploration, Research and Technology (CIOERT).</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>201008</begdate><enddate>201210</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>Ground Condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>as needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-93.82</westbc><eastbc>-93.59</eastbc><northbc>27.92</northbc><southbc>27.87</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt><themekey>Numeric Data Sets &gt; Biology</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt><themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Belt transect</themekey><themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Linear transect</themekey><themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Species richness</themekey><themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish assemblages</themekey><themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish Census</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>biota</themekey><themekey>002</themekey><themekey>environment</themekey><themekey>007</themekey><themekey>oceans</themekey><themekey>014</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>coral reef fishes</themekey></theme><place><placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt><placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Gulf of Mexico &gt; Flower Garden Banks &gt; East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey><placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Texas &gt; East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey><placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Gulf of Mexico &gt; Flower Garden Banks &gt; West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey><placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Texas &gt; West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>Please reference NOAA/NCCOS/CCMA/Biogeography Branch when utilizing these data in a report or peer reviewed publication.

Sites were randomly selected within strata (East and West Bank, low and high relief coral and depth).</complete><lineage><procstep><procdesc>A stratified random sampling design was employed to sample fish on the deep coral cap communities of the East and West Flower Garden Banks.  The survey domain at each coral cap was designated as all hard bottom areas between 110 and 150 feet.  Fine-scale (0.5 m) bathymetric data provided by the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary was used to ascertain depths and slope.  Survey sites were then randomly positioned in each stratum in ArcGIS (ESRI, 2006).  A sample frame consisting of mutually-exclusive 50m X 50m grid cells was produced and overlaid on each coral cap to exhaustively cover all diveable areas. Each grid cell was considered a sample unit and units were divided into six strata.  Strata were defined using benthic habitat and location. High (dominated by plate and head corals) and low relief (dominated by Madracis and rubble) coral categories were determined using a benthic habitat map generated by visual interpretation of multibeam data. Data were collected within 100m2 transects.  Transects radiated from the centroid of each sample unit at a random bearing.
Once in the field, the boat captain navigated to previously selected sites using a handheld GPS unit.  On-site, divers were deployed and maintained contact with each other throughout the entire census.  One diver was responsible for collecting data on benthic composition.  This diver followed the belt-transect fish diver and recorded data on small-scale benthic habitat composition and structure within a 1m2 quadrat divided into 100 (10 x 10cm) squares at 4 separate positions along the transect.  Each position was randomly chosen before entering the water such that there was one random point within every 6m interval along the transect.  Percent cover was obtained as if looking at the quadrat in a two dimensional plane (i.e. a photograph) vs. three dimensions where percent cover could add up to greater than 100%.  To estimate percent cover, the diver first positioned the quadrat at the chosen meter mark along a randomly chosen side of the transect tape. The remaining quadrats were placed on alternating sides of the transect at the last three locations.
As a rule, the habitat was not altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure, however, the observer did record fish seen in holes, under ledges and in the water column.  To identify, enumerate, or locate new individuals, divers moved off the centerline of the transect as long as they stayed within the 4m transect width and did not look back along area already covered.  The diver was allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance remaining (i.e. if the diver was at meter 15, he can look 10 meters distant, but if he was at meter 23, he could only look 2 meters ahead).
On-site, no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a sand patch or an anchor was made as these features affect fish communities and are "real" features of the habitats.  The only instance where the transect deviated from the designated path was to stay above 110 ft.  Transect lasted 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present.  This allowed more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect, and standardized the samples collected to allow for comparisons.
Data were collected on the following:
1) Logistic information - diver name, dive buddy, date, time of survey, site code, transect bearing.
2) Taxa presence - as the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed, the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect.  To decrease the total time spent writing, four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name.  In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code, alternate four-letter codes are used to distinguish between the species. These alternate codes contain the first two letters of the genus, the first letter of the species and then the first  letter in the species name that differs from the other code. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded.  If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary.
3) Abundance &amp; size - the number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length.  If an individual is greater than 35cm, then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded.
4) Photos - individuals too difficult to identify or unique in some manner may be photographed for later clarification.</procdesc><procdate>201210</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spref><horizsys><geograph><latres>0.00001</latres><longres>0.00001</longres><geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit></geograph></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>We supply abundance and size information of fish species at the lowest possible taxonomic level across all diveable portions of the coral caps within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS).
